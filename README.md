Codename: Laughing Robot
==============

A modular research survey system, built for researchers in the HMRU of UHCW. The final idea is to have a simple to use interface for the creation, distribution, and analysis of surveys.

== Planned Features ==

- Homepage for patients (Test Subjects) and researchers.
  - Researchers can create surveys using the wizards, set surveys for patients to do so it appears on their home screen,      queue up surveys for patients to complete at specified times during their stay.
  - Patients will be able to see which surveys they have been set to do, details about the project they are part of and       the protocol to which they are expected to stick to.

- Ability to export results to either .XML or .CSV formats, or direct to a database.

- (OPTIONAL) Include a way of notifying patients that they have a survey to complete, either in browser or straight from    the desktop.
